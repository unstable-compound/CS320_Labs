(a)

S->P
P->P(A)
A->P
P->

This grammar is unambiguous because when doing a leftmost derivation, there is only 
one production rule available that results in another operation being available. 


(b)
S->E
E->E+P|P
P->P*X|X
X->A^X|A
A->(E)|n

This grammar is unambiguous because when doing a leftmost derivation, the non terminal has only one production rule that gives results in the desired output.

(c)

S->A
A->B;
B->epsilon|nC
C->epsilon|,nC

This grammar is unambiguous because during leftmost derivation, the non terminal has 
only one production rule that gives a another non terminal to use.
