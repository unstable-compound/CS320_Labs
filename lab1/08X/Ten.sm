PUSH 10    initialize index counter to 10
DUP 0      make a copy for BEGIN to pop and test
BEGIN      we indent the loop body just to improve readability
  DUP 0    copy index counter  
  PRINTI   so we can print it
  PUSH 32  space 
  PRINTC   print the separator
  PUSH -1  now decrement index
  ADD
  DUP 0    again, make a copy for BEGIN to test

we end up here when index counter reaches 0
PUSH 10    newline
PRINTC
