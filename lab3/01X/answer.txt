In this code, when passing 2000000000 as the argument, the result is signed integar overflow, which is a UB in C++. 

Because the compiler is able to decide how to handle a UB, it looks to me like it was noted that mathematically 
speaking, the behavior of the function should have a<=b no matter what since b is a positive integer (2000000000)
added to a. 


So, it looks like the if statement was reduced to the equivalent of:

if (true)
    cout << a << " <= " << b << endl;


with no else clause.
